# todo-list-app
The To-Do List Web App is a simple and responsive task management tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are saved using LocalStorage, so they persist even after page refreshes. The app also supports due dates for better task organization.
